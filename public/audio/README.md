# Background Audio

To add background music to the Gospel Game:

1. Place your audio file in this directory
2. Recommended: Use a soft instrumental hymn or worship music (MP3 or WAV format)
3. Name it `background.mp3` or update the source in `src/app/page.tsx`
4. Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB recommended for web)
5. Ensure you have proper licensing/permission for any music used

## Suggested Music Style:
